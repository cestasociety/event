## CESTA presents **👩‍💻Hackathon👨‍💻**

Hi from CESTA. How's going? Hope you are good. We accepted the fate that corona is a NEW YEAR lover and follows new year resolution - "To change every new year"

So we present you a **Hackathon**. We gathered some real-world problems and summarize them into some questions which virtually impact everyone.

You need to find solution then submit it in a template you will find here, convert in PDF then update in the google forms.

## Problems

 1. Today. When I wake up I felt excess cold than usual. Because of seasonal change weather is harsh. The reason of this is carbon footprint Which is growing as we talk. As a developer what efforts can you make to reduce your Carbon footprint. As a professional developer in your company what hardware or software approach can you implement to reduce carbon footprint of the whole organization. And is it even worth it.
  *[Please include facts and resources from genuine source. May be Cloudflare can help!]*

 2. As the internet is growing, there is also a growing risk of Phishing attacks online that makes our privacy as well as some sensitive data on the brink of getting stolen. Some of these Phishing attacks are in the form of online advertisements and emails and most of these attacks at first looks good and seems to offer something and as a human we all have a tendency to get attracted to such flashy Ads or emails. What is your take on this topic "phishing attacks" and any solution on how to reduce the number of such attacks?

 3. We are using USB cable in regular use - while charging, sharing mobile data to computer and interconnection of computer as well so as we know that USB is sharing our data even if it personal so when we are specifically charging the devices so our data should be transferred by electrical appliances and even those who is charging somewhere else would access same data so how can we prevent data transmission while charging by USB

 4. In this pandemic phase , people's mainly teenagers are addicted to web show, Film 📽️ available in OTT platform,but OTT platform contains some irrelevant and adult content.Some parents  won't able to keep eye 👁️ on their children (both mother and father are working).Children are smart enough to change OTT platform settings.In this scenario how u will restrict teens to access irrelevant content.

 5. Our college is fully covered in different WIFI hotsopts at different places. As I student I want to use LAN to move data and make it available everywhere as same WIFI is divided into different subnet. The goal is to implement robust infrastructure to current WiFi network to make LAN accessible at any place. Please implement realworld networking like hybrid topography. Which is easy to implement. Map to implement is here. [This is the map.](https://github.com/cestasociety/event/blob/main/src/wifi.jpg?raw=true)

### Rules (IMPORTANT)
- You can have 3 members in a Team

- To understand further reach to a CESTA core-member.

### Submission Format
- It must include clear and to the point. Don't add unnecessary clutter.
